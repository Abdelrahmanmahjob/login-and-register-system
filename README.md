A simple web-based login and registration system built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates basic user authentication and profile display functionality for educational purposes.

## Features

- User registration with email and password
- User login authentication
- Profile page displaying user information
- Logout functionality
- Responsive and modern UI

## File Structure

```
login.html           # Login page
register.html        # Registration page
profile.html         # Profile page after login
css/styles.css       # Stylesheet for all pages
js/main.js           # Main JS logic (login/profile)
js/register.js       # JS logic for registration
```

## How to Use

1. Open `register.html` in your browser to create a new account.
2. After registration, use `login.html` to log in with your credentials.
3. Upon successful login, you will be redirected to `profile.html` where your information is displayed.
4. Click "logout" to return to the login page.

## Customization

- Update styles in `css/styles.css` for a different look.
- Extend JavaScript logic in `js/main.js` and `js/register.js` for more features (e.g., validation, persistent storage).
